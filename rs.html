<img src="images/RS_Gibraltar.PNG" alt="Strait of Gibraltar">
<p>Final map presenting the Strait of Gibraltar incorporating Landsat 8 imagery 'true-colour bands' at 30m resolution. 
Panchromatic images with a resolution of 15m from Lansat 8 were also used and
'pansharpened' to enhance the colour imagery resolution. 
SRTM data was also used to create a vertically exaggerated hillshade 
image which was applied to the Landsat image.</p>
